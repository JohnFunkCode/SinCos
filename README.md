# SinCos
This simple java script program demonstrates the simple concept of graphing the Sine function against the Cosine function. You can see it in action by visiting http://www.johnfunk.com/SinAndCos.html

Experimenting with graphing the sin() and cos() functions is one of things that sparked my interest in math and computers back in the early 1980s.  This fire and curriosity lead me to study computer science and applied mathamatics and lead me to long career in software.

Hopefully this will inspire currosity and possibly the spark of inspiration for someone just getting started with software development.
